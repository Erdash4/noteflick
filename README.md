# Noteflick
Noteflick is a [PenguinMod](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html) based web application that can be used to chat, watch TV shows or movies, and serve as a platform for a collection of internet proxies (mainly [Rammerhead](https://browser.rammerhead.org/) ones).
This repo is responisble for hosting the client on [the site for the client.](https://client.noteflick.xyz.), and also has the .pmp (PenguinMod Project) file, which can be opened in PenguinMod to be edited. 

## THIS PROJECT IS VERY MESSY! 
Apologies for the messiness of the project, but it was never meant to be open source until now, so there will be an abundant amount duct-tape fixes, strange quirks, and stuff like that.
